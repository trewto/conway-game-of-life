## Rules of the Game of Life:

  # Survival:
        Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive to the next generation.
        This rule prevents cells from dying when they are in a stable or moderately crowded environment.

   # Death by Isolation:
        Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (as if by underpopulation).
        This occurs because the cell is too isolated to survive.

   # Death by Overcrowding:
        Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (as if by overpopulation).
        This happens because the cell is in an overcrowded environment.

   # Reproduction:
        Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell (as if by reproduction).
        A new cell is "born" in an environment with the right amount of neighboring cells.
